Banking System
A console-based banking system implemented in Java using linked lists for dynamic account management. This project demonstrates core banking operations and showcases proficiency in data structures and object-oriented programming.
Overview
This project is a simple banking application that allows users to:

Create new bank accounts with unique account numbers.
Deposit and withdraw money from accounts.
Check account balances.
View details of all existing accounts.

The system uses a singly linked list to efficiently manage account data, making it scalable for adding new accounts dynamically.
Features

Account Creation: Automatically assigns a unique account number and initializes balance to zero.
Deposit: Adds funds to an existing account with balance validation.
Withdrawal: Removes funds with checks for sufficient balance.
Balance Inquiry: Displays the current balance and account holder name.
View All Accounts: Lists all accounts with their details (account number, name, and balance).
